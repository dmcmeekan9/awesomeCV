I am currently a senior at Western Illinois University and I will be obtaining my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science this May. My plan is to continue my education for one more year after I graduate through the integrated program to achieve my Master's Degree in Computer Science. Throughout these years of learning and developing skills through lecture, readings, and practice, I have learned many important attributes and talents that have made me the programmer and developer I am today. But, I know that I still have room to learn and develop my skills through experience and hard work. I see great importance in being able to maximize my abilities all while ensuring my social and work ethic skills in this company stay up to par. I take great pride to ensure my best quality of work and am fully invested in exceeding my expectations and going past my maximum potential.
