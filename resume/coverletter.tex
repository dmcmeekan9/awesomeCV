\begin{cvletter}
\lettersection{About Me}

I am a twenty-two year old student at Western Illinois University who owns a great work ethic and ability to learn. I grew up in a small town named Sherrard, Illinois. I knew at a young age that I wanted to go into computer programming and networking, this becoming my motivation to continue my schooling at Western Illinois University. I have overcame adversity to get to where I am today, through the loss of my mother at a young age and then dealing with rough childhood circumstances in the years to follow. My circumstances have driven me to excel in everything that I do by putting forth my maximum effort. I have focused on developing excellent programming and computer skills that will only continue to grow.

\lettersection{Why COMPANY NAME?}

I want to be able to provide insight and ideas that will help expand and develop COMPANY NAME product offerings, infrastructure, and software development. Ranging from improving customer's daily actions to developing substantial technology that assists engineering, these will further push individuals across the world to achieve daily success. With this opportunity, I am excited to gain a deep understanding of the processes involved to make these ideas happen and the technology behind it expanding upon my prior experience at Principal Financial Group. With PFG, I held a position that allowed me to thrive and learn valuable knowledge of developing in a professional environment, through languages such as Java, JCL, and C/C++. The main projects that I was able to develop with included mainframe modernization, an effort aimed to improve more towards a future development standard of enterprise technology. As well as improving existing technologies and fixing outstanding issues that would arise. I cannot wait to learn all the new skills COMPANY NAME requires and am ready to dive in, enhance my knowledge, and use past and new skills to continue adding to COMPANY NAME success.
\lettersection{Why Me?}

I know that I am ready to take the next step in my life and work for COMPANY NAME. Even if I find this opportunity to be challenging, I know that I will be able to persevere. I fully believe that every individual in this world has the opportunity to do something bigger than themselves, and I am looking for my opportunity to prove that. From a logistics standpoint, I know I am ready to use and further develop programming and technology skills that allow COMPANY NAME to thrive and continue to push success.
